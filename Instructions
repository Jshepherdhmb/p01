Your task for this project is to create a new version of the retro interactive story. You will create a Retro Web Adventure, where the user reads a short passage of a story and then has multiple choices for what the story's character should do. Those choices will be hypertext links that will bring the user to a new page with the next part of the story, according to the reader's choice. Your story should have:

    One page for each story segment
    Each story segment page should have a short (~1 paragraph) explanation of what is happening in the story, followed by a list of (at least two) choices. Each choice should provide a link to its corresponding story segment
    The shortest path through your story should have at least 5 segment pages (including both the beginning and end page)
    Story lines may converge, but there should be at least two possible endings
    At least two images that help supplement your story.
    Written by yourself using your own creativity, however, it may be "inspired" by a popular story/movie/book/game/etc. You MAY use others' images, but if you do, there should be a link immediately below the image that refers to where the image was found and should have the text "Image Source"

The technical requirements are:

    Each story segment should have its own HTML page and all HTML should validate without errors/warnings (using the tool available in resources)
    The story should have a cohesive, appealing visual design and layout
    The pages should all use the same external CSS file that defines the style appropriately
    All HTML and CSS should be easy to read and follow good practices taught in class.
    The "start" of the story should be in a file called index.html
    The design should use web-safe fonts but NOT the default browser font
    The design should NOT use solid white (i.e. #FFFFFF) background
    The design should NOT have any fully black (i.e. #000000) text
    The layout should have at least two columns
    Your full name should be put in comments in all files
    You should post your project to your personal GitHub account as a public repository
